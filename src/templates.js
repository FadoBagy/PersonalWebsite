    <h2>Skill Set</h2> 
    <p>
        As a programmer, I like to think of myself as a language wizard, with varying levels of proficiency
        in different programming languages.

        For example, I am a <span>Python</span> ninja, with several years of experience in both web
        development and data
        analysis using frameworks such as Django and Pandas. I can make a website or analyze data with my
        eyes closed, it's that good!
    </p>
    <p>
        In <span>Java</span>, I am a Spring-er, proficient in developing both standalone and web
        applications using
        Spring framework, I can make a enterprise level application like a boss.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <span>C++</span>, I am a graphics wizard, I have a strong understanding of the language and have
        experience
        working on projects related to computer graphics and game development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have working knowledge in <span>JavaScript</span> and familiar with various frameworks such
        as React and
        Angular, and I can make your website move like a pro.

    <p>
        Additionally, I am familiar with <span>SQL</span> and have experience working with databases.
